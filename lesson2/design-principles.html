            <p> When visiting a page for a specific book on Audible, the first draw to your attention using a large
                white square to the membership plan. Once in the white box, your eyes are drawn to the large yellow
                button
                encouraging users to start a free trial. Finally, if not enticed by the monthly membership, your eyes
                move down to the next large button with the price to purchase the book. This movement using size and
                color, exemplifies visual hierarchy.
