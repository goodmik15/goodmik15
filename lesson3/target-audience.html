            <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
            <p>A Little Weathered is targeted towards working-class adults and their spouses. In this
                area, they are most likely to be white, married, have a high school diploma, have a couple of kids, and
                work in the phosphate industry, making weed-killer or fertilizer. The majority of these workers drive
                15-25 minutes to get to work, depending on how rural their area is. </p>

                <h4>Jacob Smith</h4>
                <p>Jacob is a 30-year-old blue-collar worker. He lives in Soda Springs, Idaho, and works 15 minutes away
                    as a phosphate miner in the Conda Mine run by Itafos. Jacob has been at the mine since graduating
                    from high school. He now works as a Surveyor for the site. Jacob checks the weather every single day
                    as he prepares for his commute to work. Weather always has to be factored-in while working at an
                    open mine site. </p>

                <ul>

                <h4>Hannah Johnson</h4>
                <p>Hannah is a 33-year-old full-time soccer mom. She lives in Fish Haven, Idaho, with her husband and
                    two kids. She runs an Etsy store home business when she can and runs her kids to various activities
                    the rest of the time. Hannah stays on top of the weather to make sure the softball game is still
                    happening on Friday night and to see if the kids can go fishing with their dad over the weekend so
                    she can get some work done. </p>
